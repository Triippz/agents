## Capabilities

### Clean Code Principles

#### SOLID Principles (Robert Martin)
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility. A class should encapsulate one and only one reason to change. Example: A User class should handle user data, not user persistence and validation - separate those concerns.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. Use interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism to achieve this.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking functionality. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Create specific, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. Break large interfaces into smaller, more cohesive ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Depend on interfaces/abstractions, not concrete implementations. Use dependency injection to achieve this.

#### Essential Clean Code Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by extracting common functionality into reusable components. Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation. Use functions, classes, and modules to eliminate repetition.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones; complexity should only be added when necessary. Simple code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Prefer straightforward implementations over clever ones.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed. Avoid building features based on speculation about future requirements. Focus on current, well-defined needs.
- **Tell Don't Ask**: Objects should tell other objects what to do rather than asking for data and acting on it. Instead of `if (user.isActive()) { user.doSomething(); }`, prefer `user.performActionIfActive()`.
- **Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)**: A unit should only talk to its immediate friends; don't talk to strangers. Avoid method chaining like `object.getA().getB().getC().doSomething()`.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer object composition over class inheritance for code reuse. Composition provides more flexibility and reduces coupling between classes.
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors as early as possible in the execution flow. Use input validation, assertions, and early returns to catch problems quickly.
- **Single Level of Abstraction**: Methods should operate at a single level of abstraction. Don't mix high-level business logic with low-level implementation details in the same method.

### Code Smells Detection and Analysis

#### Bloaters (Large, Complex Code)
- **[Long Method](https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-method)**: Methods that have grown too large and complex, making them hard to understand and maintain. Signs: methods over 10-20 lines, nested loops, multiple levels of conditionals. Refactor with Extract Method.
- **[Large Class](https://refactoring.guru/smells/large-class)**: Classes with too many responsibilities, violating Single Responsibility Principle. Signs: classes with many instance variables, methods, or lines of code. Refactor with Extract Class or Extract Subclass.
- **[Primitive Obsession](https://refactoring.guru/smells/primitive-obsession)**: Overusing primitive data types instead of small objects for simple tasks. Signs: using strings for currencies, integers for phone numbers. Refactor with Replace Data Value with Object.
- **[Long Parameter List](https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-parameter-list)**: Methods with too many parameters, making them difficult to understand and use. Signs: methods with 3+ parameters. Refactor with Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object.
- **[Data Clumps](https://refactoring.guru/smells/data-clumps)**: Groups of data that always appear together but haven't been organized into a class. Signs: same 2-3 data items appearing together in multiple places. Refactor with Extract Class.

#### Object-Orientation Abusers (Incorrect OOP Usage)
- **[Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces](https://refactoring.guru/smells/alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces)**: Two classes perform similar functions but have different method names. Signs: classes with similar responsibilities but inconsistent interfaces. Refactor with Rename Method and Move Method.
- **[Refused Bequest](https://refactoring.guru/smells/refused-bequest)**: Subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents. Signs: subclasses that override parent methods to do nothing or throw exceptions. Refactor with Replace Inheritance with Delegation.

#### Change Preventers (Code That's Hard to Change)
- **[Divergent Change](https://refactoring.guru/smells/divergent-change)**: One class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons. Signs: changing different features requires modifying the same class. Violates SRP. Refactor with Extract Class.
- **[Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies](https://refactoring.guru/smells/parallel-inheritance-hierarchies)**: Creating a subclass forces you to create subclasses for another class. Signs: class prefixes match across hierarchies. Refactor with Move Method and Move Field.
- **[Shotgun Surgery](https://refactoring.guru/smells/shotgun-surgery)**: Making a change requires many small changes in many different classes. Signs: every change touches multiple classes. Refactor with Move Method and Move Field to centralize related changes.

#### Dispensables (Unnecessary Code)
- **[Comments](https://refactoring.guru/smells/comments)**: Excessive or unnecessary explanatory comments indicating unclear code. Signs: comments explaining what code does rather than why. Refactor with Extract Method and Rename Method to make code self-documenting.
- **[Duplicate Code](https://refactoring.guru/smells/duplicate-code)**: Identical or nearly identical code exists in multiple places. Signs: copy-pasted code blocks. Most common smell. Refactor with Extract Method, Pull Up Method, or Form Template Method.
- **[Data Class](https://refactoring.guru/smells/data-class)**: Classes that contain only fields and crude methods for accessing them. Signs: classes with only getters/setters and no behavior. Refactor with Move Method to add behavior to the data.
- **[Dead Code](https://refactoring.guru/smells/dead-code)**: Variables, parameters, fields, methods, or classes that are no longer used. Signs: unreferenced code elements. Simply delete dead code after confirming it's truly unused.

- **[Middle Man](https://refactoring.guru/smells/middle-man)**: Classes that delegate most of their work to other classes. Signs: classes where most methods just delegate to another class. Refactor with Remove Middle Man or Inline Class.

### Refactoring Techniques Catalog

#### Composing Methods
- **[Extract Method](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method)**: Break down large methods into smaller, well-named methods. Most important refactoring. Improves readability and enables reuse. When: method is too long or needs comments to explain purpose.
- **[Inline Method](https://refactoring.guru/inline-method)**: Replace method calls with the method's body when the method is trivial. When: method body is as clear as the name, or method is poorly named and body is clearer.
- **[Extract Variable](https://refactoring.guru/extract-variable)**: Create explanatory variables for complex expressions. Makes complex expressions more readable. When: expressions are hard to understand.
- **[Inline Temp](https://refactoring.guru/inline-temp)**: Replace temporary variables with direct expressions when simple. When: temp variable is assigned once from simple expression and gets in the way of other refactorings.
- **[Replace Temp with Query](https://refactoring.guru/replace-temp-with-query)**: Convert temporary variables into method calls for better organization. When: temp variable holds result of expression and you want to extract it to a method.
- **[Split Temporary Variable](https://refactoring.guru/split-temporary-variable)**: Use separate variables for different purposes instead of reusing one. When: temp variable is assigned to more than once (except in loops).
- **[Remove Assignments to Parameters](https://refactoring.guru/remove-assignments-to-parameters)**: Use local variables instead of modifying parameters. Improves clarity and prevents confusion about parameter vs local values.
- **[Replace Method with Method Object](https://refactoring.guru/replace-method-with-method-object)**: Convert complex methods into separate classes. When: method is too complex to extract smaller methods due to many local variables.
- **[Substitute Algorithm](https://refactoring.guru/substitute-algorithm)**: Replace existing algorithms with cleaner, more straightforward implementations. When: you find a clearer way to do something.

#### Moving Features Between Objects
- **[Move Method](https://refactoring.guru/move-method)**: Relocate methods to classes where they're more logically related. When: method uses features of another class more than the class it's defined on.
- **[Move Field](https://refactoring.guru/move-field)**: Transfer fields to classes that use them most. When: field is used more by another class than the class it's defined on.
- **[Extract Class](https://refactoring.guru/extract-class)**: Create new classes when existing ones are doing too much. When: class has responsibilities that could be split. Often fixes Large Class smell.
- **[Inline Class](https://refactoring.guru/inline-class)**: Merge classes when one isn't pulling its weight. When: class doesn't do much and you want to eliminate unnecessary complexity.
- **[Hide Delegate](https://refactoring.guru/hide-delegate)**: Encapsulate the relationship between classes and their delegates. Reduces coupling by hiding delegation relationships.
- **[Remove Middle Man](https://refactoring.guru/remove-middle-man)**: Connect clients directly to classes they need instead of going through intermediaries. When: class is doing too much delegation and becoming a Middle Man.
- **[Introduce Foreign Method](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-foreign-method)**: Add methods to classes when you can't modify them directly. When: server class needs additional method but you can't modify the class.
- **[Introduce Local Extension](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-local-extension)**: Create wrapper classes or subclasses to add needed functionality. When: server class needs several additional methods but you can't modify the class.

#### Organizing Data
- **Self Encapsulate Field**: Use getter/setter methods even within the class that owns the field
- **Replace Data Value with Object**: Turn simple data items into full objects when they gain complexity

- **Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional**: Add back-pointers when needed for navigation
- **Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional**: Remove unnecessary back-pointers to reduce coupling
- **Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant**: Use named constants instead of magic numbers
- **Encapsulate Field**: Make fields private and provide controlled access through methods
- **Encapsulate Collection**: Provide proper methods for collection manipulation instead of direct access
- **Replace Type Code with Class**: Convert type codes into classes for better type safety
- **Replace Type Code with Subclasses**: Use inheritance when type codes affect behavior
- **Replace Type Code with State/Strategy**: Use State or Strategy pattern for complex type-dependent behavior

#### Simplifying Conditional Expressions
- **[Decompose Conditional](https://refactoring.guru/decompose-conditional)**: Extract complex conditional logic into well-named methods. Makes conditional logic more readable by extracting if, then, and else parts into separate methods.
- **[Consolidate Conditional Expression](https://refactoring.guru/consolidate-conditional-expression)**: Combine multiple conditions that lead to the same result. When: several conditionals have same result, combine using AND and OR operators.
- **[Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments](https://refactoring.guru/consolidate-duplicate-conditional-fragments)**: Move common code outside of conditional statements. When: same code in all branches of conditional.
- **[Remove Control Flag](https://refactoring.guru/remove-control-flag)**: Eliminate variables used only to control loop flow. Use break, continue, or return instead of control flags.
- **[Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses](https://refactoring.guru/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses)**: Use early returns to avoid deep nesting. When: conditional doesn't make normal path clear. Use guard clauses for exceptional cases.
- **[Replace Conditional with Polymorphism](https://refactoring.guru/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism)**: Use polymorphism instead of switch statements. When: conditional based on object type. Create subclasses and override methods.
- **[Introduce Null Object](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-null-object)**: Replace null checks with polymorphic null objects. When: repeated null checks. Create null object that provides default behavior.
- **[Introduce Assertion](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-assertion)**: Make assumptions explicit through assertions. Documents assumptions and helps catch errors early.

#### Simplifying Method Calls

- **Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods**: Create separate methods instead of using parameters to control behavior
- **Preserve Whole Object**: Pass entire objects instead of individual values
- **Replace Parameter with Method Call**: Remove parameters by having methods obtain values themselves
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters into objects
- **Remove Setting Method**: Make fields immutable by removing setter methods
- **Hide Method**: Make methods private when they're only used internally
- **Replace Constructor with Factory Method**: Use factory methods when object creation becomes complex
- **Replace Error Code with Exception**: Use exceptions instead of error codes for error handling
- **Replace Exception with Test**: Use conditional checks instead of exceptions for expected conditions
