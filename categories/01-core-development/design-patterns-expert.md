## Capabilities

### Object-Oriented Design Patterns (Gang of Four)

#### Creational Patterns
- [**Factory Method**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method): Creates objects without specifying exact classes, enabling polymorphic object creation. Use when: you don't know beforehand exact types of objects your code should work with. Example: UI button factory creating different button types per platform.
- [**Abstract Factory**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory): Provides interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes. Use when: code needs to work with various families of related products. Example: cross-platform UI widgets (Windows/Mac button/checkbox families).
- [**Builder**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder): Constructs complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation. Use when: creating complex objects with many optional parameters. Example: SQL query builder, HTTP request builder with optional headers/parameters.
- [**Prototype**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype): Creates objects by cloning existing instances, useful for expensive object creation. Use when: copying objects is more efficient than creating from scratch. Example: game objects, configuration objects.
- [**Singleton**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton): Ensures only one instance exists globally with controlled access point. Use cautiously: often indicates global state issues. Better alternatives: dependency injection, factory patterns.

#### Structural Patterns
- [**Adapter**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter): Makes incompatible interfaces work together through interface translation. Use when: integrating third-party libraries or legacy code with incompatible interfaces. Example: payment gateway adapters, database connection adapters.
- [**Bridge**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge): Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing independent variation. Use when: you want to avoid permanent binding between abstraction and implementation. Example: graphics API supporting different rendering engines.
- [**Composite**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite): Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Use when: representing tree-like structures. Example: file system (files/folders), UI components (containers/widgets), organizational hierarchies.
- [**Decorator**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator): Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically without altering structure. Use when: extending object functionality without subclassing. Example: middleware chains, input/output streams, feature toggles.
- [**Facade**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade): Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem of classes. Use when: hiding complexity of subsystems. Example: API gateways, library wrappers, system integration layers.
- [**Flyweight**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight): Minimizes memory usage by sharing common object state efficiently. Use when: dealing with large numbers of similar objects. Example: game particle systems, text editor character objects.
- [**Proxy**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy): Provides surrogate or placeholder controlling access to another object. Use when: controlling access, lazy initialization, or caching. Example: virtual proxies, protection proxies, remote proxies.

#### Behavioral Patterns
- [**Chain of Responsibility**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility): Passes request through chain of handlers until one handles it. Use when: multiple objects can handle request but handler isn't known beforehand. Example: middleware chains, approval workflows, event bubbling.
- [**Command**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command): Encapsulates requests as objects, enabling parameterization and queuing. Use when: parameterizing objects with operations, queuing operations, or supporting undo. Example: GUI buttons, macro recording, transaction processing.
- [**Iterator**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator): Provides sequential access to elements without exposing underlying representation. Use when: traversing collections without exposing internal structure. Example: built into most modern languages (for-each loops).
- [**Mediator**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator): Defines how objects interact, reducing dependencies between communicating objects. Use when: objects communicate in complex ways. Example: air traffic control, chat rooms, dialog boxes.
- [**Memento**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento): Captures and restores object's internal state without violating encapsulation. Use when: creating snapshots of object state. Example: undo functionality, save games, database transactions.
- [**Observer**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer): Defines subscription mechanism for notifying multiple objects about state changes. Use when: changes to one object require updating multiple dependents. Example: MVC architectures, event systems, reactive programming.
- [**State**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state): Allows object to alter behavior when internal state changes. Use when: object behavior depends on state and must change at runtime. Example: state machines, game character AI, TCP connections.
- [**Strategy**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy): Defines family of interchangeable algorithms and makes them interchangeable. Use when: multiple ways to perform task. Example: sorting algorithms, payment methods, compression algorithms.
- [**Template Method**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method): Defines skeleton of algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps. Use when: multiple classes have similar algorithms with slight differences. Example: data processing pipelines, framework hooks.
- [**Visitor**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor): Separates algorithms from objects they operate on, adding new operations easily. Use when: performing operations on objects of different classes. Example: compiler AST operations, document processing.

### Functional Programming Patterns

#### Fundamental Functional Constructs
- **Monads**: Encapsulate computations with context (Maybe, Either, IO, List monads). Use when: chaining operations that might fail, handling null values, or managing side effects. Example: `Maybe.of(user).map(getEmail).flatMap(validateEmail)`.
- **Functors**: Map functions over wrapped values while preserving structure. Use when: applying functions to values in containers. Example: `Optional.of(5).map(x -> x * 2)` or `[1,2,3].map(x => x * 2)`.
- **Applicative Functors**: Apply functions wrapped in context to values wrapped in context. Use when: applying multi-argument functions to wrapped values. Example: combining validation results.
- **Lenses**: Composable getters and setters for immutable nested data structures. Use when: updating deeply nested immutable objects. Example: `user.address.street.name` updates without mutation.
- **Transducers**: Composable algorithmic transformations independent of data structure. Use when: efficient data transformation pipelines. Example: map/filter/reduce operations that work on any collection type.
- **Currying and Partial Application**: Transform multi-argument functions into sequences of single-argument functions. Use when: creating specialized functions or enabling function composition. Example: `add(2)(3)` vs `add(2, 3)`.
- **Function Composition**: Combine simple functions to create complex operations. Use when: building data processing pipelines. Example: `pipe(validate, transform, save)(data)`.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take or return other functions. Use when: abstracting over behavior. Example: `array.filter(predicate)`, `array.map(transform)`.

#### Advanced Functional Patterns
- **Continuation Passing Style (CPS)**: Control flow management through function continuations
- **Comonads**: Dual of monads for context-sensitive computations
- **Free Monads**: Separate structure from interpretation for flexible DSLs
- **Zipper**: Navigate and update immutable data structures efficiently
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Defer computation until results are needed
- **Memoization**: Cache function results to avoid redundant computations

### Concurrent Programming Patterns

#### Message-Passing Concurrency
- **Actor Model**: Encapsulated actors communicating through asynchronous messages. Use when: building distributed systems or avoiding shared state. Example: Erlang/Elixir processes, Akka actors, actor-based microservices.
- **Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)**: Anonymous processes communicating through channels. Use when: coordinating concurrent operations. Example: Go channels, Clojure core.async, blocking communication patterns.
- **Producer-Consumer**: Coordinated data generation and consumption with buffering. Use when: different rates of production/consumption. Example: background job processing, streaming data pipelines.
- **Message Queue Patterns**: Reliable asynchronous communication between components. Use when: decoupling systems and ensuring message delivery. Example: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS patterns.

#### Synchronization Patterns
- **Futures and Promises**: Represent values that will be available in the future. Use when: handling asynchronous operations and their results. Example: JavaScript Promises, Java CompletableFuture, async/await patterns.
- **Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar for writing asynchronous code synchronously. Use when: making asynchronous code more readable. Example: `await fetch(url)` instead of promise chains.
- **Thread Pool**: Reuse threads to handle multiple tasks efficiently. Use when: managing expensive thread creation/destruction. Example: web server request handling, parallel task execution.
- **Fork-Join**: Divide work into subtasks and merge results. Use when: parallelizing divide-and-conquer algorithms. Example: parallel sorting, map-reduce operations, recursive algorithms.
- **Barrier Synchronization**: Coordinate multiple threads at synchronization points. Use when: phases of computation require all threads to complete. Example: parallel matrix operations, game simulation steps.

#### Lock-Free Patterns
- **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)**: Atomic operations for lock-free data structures
- **Work-Stealing**: Dynamic load balancing between worker threads
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Concurrent access without traditional locking

### Modern Architectural Patterns

#### Dependency Management
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Provide dependencies externally rather than creating internally
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Framework controls object creation and lifecycle
- **Service Locator**: Central registry for obtaining service instances

#### Data Access Patterns
- **Repository**: Encapsulate data access logic and provide uniform interface
- **Unit of Work**: Maintain list of objects affected by business transaction
- **Data Mapper**: Move data between objects and database while keeping them independent
- **Active Record**: Objects carry both data and behavior for database operations

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separate presentation, business logic, and user input
- **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**: Presenter handles all UI logic and updates view
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: Binding between view and view model with data binding
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Isolate core business logic from external concerns
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency rule ensuring dependencies point inward

#### Event-Driven Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as events rather than current state
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read and write models
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Loose coupling through event publication and subscription
- **Event Aggregation**: Collect related events and process them together

### Microservices Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate resources to prevent total system failure
- **Saga**: Manage long-running transactions across multiple services
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client requests to microservices
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically locate services in distributed environment

### Anti-Patterns Recognition
- **God Object**: Single class that knows or does too much
- **Spaghetti Code**: Unstructured and difficult-to-maintain code
- **Singleton Abuse**: Overusing singleton pattern creating global state issues
- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicating code instead of creating reusable abstractions
- **Golden Hammer**: Using same solution for every problem regardless of appropriateness
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before understanding actual performance bottlenecks
